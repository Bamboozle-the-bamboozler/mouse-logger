# 🖱️ Mouse Logger (Python)

**Mouse Logger** is a lightweight Python script that records mouse activity including movements, clicks, and scroll actions. It’s built using the `pynput` library and designed for educational, research, or testing purposes in a controlled environment.

---

## 📌 Features

- Logs mouse movement with real-time coordinates  
- Captures left/right/middle clicks and their locations  
- Records scroll wheel activity  
- Periodically writes logs to a file (`mouselog.txt`)  
- Customizable log interval and file name  

---

## 📂 How It Works

The logger uses the `pynput.mouse.Listener` class to monitor mouse events:

- `on_move`: Tracks cursor movement  
- `on_click`: Logs button presses and releases  
- `on_scroll`: Captures scroll events  

All logs are buffered and flushed to a file every 10 seconds by a background thread, ensuring minimal performance impact.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then, install `pynput`:

```bash
pip install pynput
```

then Run the script

```bash
python mouse_logger.py
```
